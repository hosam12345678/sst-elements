## üî¥ **High Priority - Correctness Issues**

### 1. Delete Underflow Handling
**Status**: Not implemented  
**Impact**: Tree becomes sparse over time with many deletes  
**Description**:
- Currently, DELETE removes keys but doesn't handle underflow
- When a node has fewer than `fanout/2` keys, should:
  1. Try to borrow keys from siblings
  2. If siblings are also minimal, merge nodes
  3. Propagate merges up the tree (may reduce tree height)

**Implementation Steps**:
```cpp
void handle_delete_underflow_async(AsyncOperation& op, BTreeNode& leaf) {
    uint32_t min_keys = (btree_fanout + 1) / 2;
    if (leaf.num_keys < min_keys && leaf.node_address != root_address) {
        // Phase 1: Read left and right siblings
        // Phase 2: Try to borrow from left sibling
        // Phase 3: Try to borrow from right sibling
        // Phase 4: If both minimal, merge with sibling
        // Phase 5: Update parent (may trigger parent merge)
    }
}
```

**Files to modify**:
- `computeServer.h`: Add BORROW_FROM_SIBLING, MERGE_NODES enum values
- `computeServer.cc`: Implement borrow/merge logic in handle_leaf_operation

---

### 2. Parent Address Lookup Fallback
**Status**: Warning printed but not handled  
**Impact**: Splits fail if parent not in parent_map  
**Description**:
- `parent_map` is built during traversal, but parent might not be there
- Currently prints warning and sets `parent_address = 0`
- Should implement actual parent search by traversing tree

**Implementation Steps**:
```cpp
void find_parent_async(uint64_t child_addr, uint32_t child_level) {
    // Create READ_PARENT_SEARCH state
    // Traverse from root to level above child
    // At each level, check children pointers
    // When found, save to parent_map for future use
}
```

**Files to modify**:
- `computeServer.h`: Add FIND_PARENT_SEARCH phase
- `computeServer.cc`: Implement tree traversal to find parent

---

## üü° **Medium Priority - Performance Optimizations**

### 3. Binary Search in Leaf Nodes
**Status**: Currently using linear search  
**Impact**: O(n) search time in leaves instead of O(log n)  
**Description**:
- `handle_leaf_operation` uses linear scan for SEARCH and DELETE
- Should use binary search for better performance

**Implementation**:
```cpp
uint32_t binary_search_leaf(const BTreeNode& leaf, uint64_t key) {
    uint32_t left = 0, right = leaf.num_keys;
    while (left < right) {
        uint32_t mid = (left + right) / 2;
        if (leaf.keys[mid] < key) left = mid + 1;
        else right = mid;
    }
    return left;
}
```

**Files to modify**:
- `computeServer.cc`: Add binary_search_leaf helper function

---

### 4. Sibling Pointers for Range Scans
**Status**: Not implemented  
**Impact**: Cannot do efficient range queries  
**Description**:
- Leaf nodes should have `next_leaf` pointer to right sibling
- Enables efficient range scans without tree traversal

**Implementation Steps**:
```cpp
struct BTreeNode {
    // ... existing fields ...
    uint64_t next_leaf;  // Pointer to next leaf (0 if last)
};

void split_leaf_async(...) {
    // After split:
    new_leaf.next_leaf = old_leaf.next_leaf;
    old_leaf.next_leaf = new_leaf.node_address;
}

void btree_range_scan_async(uint64_t start_key, uint64_t end_key) {
    // 1. Find leaf containing start_key
    // 2. Follow next_leaf pointers until end_key
    // 3. Return all keys in range
}
```

**Files to modify**:
- `computeServer.h`: Add next_leaf to BTreeNode, add range scan function
- `computeServer.cc`: Update splits, implement range_scan_async

---

### 5. Bulk Loading Optimization
**Status**: Not implemented  
**Impact**: Building large trees is slower than necessary  
**Description**:
- Currently insert one key at a time
- Bulk loading can build tree bottom-up more efficiently

**Implementation**:
```cpp
void bulk_load_async(std::vector<std::pair<uint64_t, uint64_t>>& sorted_keys) {
    // 1. Sort keys
    // 2. Create leaf nodes in one pass
    // 3. Build internal nodes bottom-up
    // 4. Write all nodes to memory
}
```

---

## üü¢ **Low Priority - Nice to Have**

### 6. Tree Consistency Checker
**Status**: Not implemented  
**Impact**: Harder to debug correctness issues  
**Description**:
- Validate tree structure after operations
- Check: key ordering, fanout constraints, parent-child consistency

**Implementation**:
```cpp
bool validate_tree_async() {
    // 1. Traverse entire tree
    // 2. Check each node:
    //    - Keys are sorted
    //    - Num keys within [min, max]
    //    - Children pointers valid
    // 3. Check all leaves reachable
    // 4. Check total key count matches expected
}
```

---

### 7. Tree Visualization/Debugging
**Status**: Not implemented  
**Impact**: Harder to understand tree structure during development  
**Description**:
- Print tree structure in readable format
- Show keys, addresses, levels

**Implementation**:
```cpp
void print_tree_structure() {
    // Breadth-first traversal
    // Print each level with indentation
    // Show keys and addresses
}
```

---

### 8. Concurrency Control (Future)
**Status**: Not needed for single-compute-server simulation  
**Impact**: Required for multi-compute-server workloads  
**Description**:
- Add locking mechanism
- Lock coupling during traversal
- Deadlock detection/avoidance

**Note**: Only needed when simulating multiple compute servers accessing same tree concurrently.

---

### 9. Write-Ahead Logging (Future)
**Status**: Not needed for simulation  
**Impact**: Required for crash recovery  
**Description**:
- Log operations before executing
- Replay log after crash
- Ensure durability

**Note**: SST simulation doesn't model crashes, so this is academic.
