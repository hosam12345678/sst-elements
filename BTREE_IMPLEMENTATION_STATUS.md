# B+Tree Implementation Status

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This is NOT a Full B+Tree Implementation

This implementation is a **working prototype** focused on demonstrating disaggregated memory operations over RDMA. It implements core B+tree operations but **lacks many production-ready features**.

---

## ‚úÖ What IS Implemented

### 1. **Basic Tree Structure**
- ‚úÖ B+tree node structure (internal + leaf nodes)
- ‚úÖ Configurable fanout (number of keys per node)
- ‚úÖ Tree height calculation based on key range
- ‚úÖ Level-based memory allocation across multiple memory servers
- ‚úÖ Parent-child relationships tracked via `parent_map`

### 2. **Core Operations**

#### ‚úÖ **INSERT (Fully Implemented)**
```cpp
void btree_insert(uint64_t key, uint64_t value)
```
**What works:**
- Traverse to appropriate leaf node
- Insert key-value pair in sorted order
- Detect duplicate keys (rejects duplicates)
- Detect full leaf nodes
- **Split leaf nodes** when full (50/50 distribution)
- **Propagate separator key to parent**
- **Recursive parent splitting** when parent is full
- **Root split** (increases tree height)
- Write modified nodes back to memory servers via RDMA

**Limitations:**
- No bulk insert optimization
- No insert buffering
- Sequential inserts (no batch operations)

#### ‚úÖ **SEARCH (Fully Implemented)**
```cpp
void btree_search(uint64_t key)
```
**What works:**
- Traverse from root to appropriate leaf
- Binary search within leaf node for key
- Return value if found
- Cross-server RDMA reads during traversal
- Uses local buffers for intermediate nodes

**Limitations:**
- Single key lookup only (no range queries)
- No caching beyond `cached_nodes` simulation
- No prefetching optimization

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **DELETE (Partially Implemented)**
```cpp
void btree_delete(uint64_t key)
```
**What works:**
- Traverse to leaf containing key
- Remove key from leaf
- Detect underflow condition
- Write modified leaf back

**What's MISSING (Critical):**
- ‚ùå **Borrow from sibling** when underflow occurs
- ‚ùå **Merge with sibling** when borrowing not possible
- ‚ùå **Update parent keys** after merge
- ‚ùå **Propagate merges up the tree**
- ‚ùå **Decrease tree height** when root becomes empty

**Current behavior:** Warns about underflow but doesn't fix it!

### 3. **Split Operations**

#### ‚úÖ **Leaf Node Split**
```cpp
void split_leaf(BTreeNode& old_leaf, uint64_t new_key, uint64_t new_value)
```
**Fully implemented:**
- Combines existing keys + new key
- Sorts all keys
- Distributes 50/50 between old and new leaf
- Allocates address for new leaf
- Writes both nodes to memory
- Calls `insert_into_parent()` with separator key

#### ‚úÖ **Internal Node Split**
```cpp
void split_internal(BTreeNode& old_internal, uint64_t new_key, 
                    uint64_t new_child, uint32_t level)
```
**Fully implemented:**
- Combines existing keys + new key and children
- Promotes middle key to parent
- Distributes keys/children to left and right nodes
- Handles root split (creates new root, increases height)
- Recursive splitting up the tree

#### ‚úÖ **Parent Update**
```cpp
void insert_into_parent(uint64_t old_node_addr, uint64_t new_node_addr, 
                       uint64_t separator_key, uint32_t level)
```
**Fully implemented:**
- Finds parent using `parent_map` or tree traversal
- Inserts separator key and new child pointer
- Detects full parent ‚Üí triggers `split_internal()`
- Handles root split (creates new root)

### 4. **Tree Traversal**
```cpp
BTreeNode traverse_to_leaf(uint64_t key)
```
**Fully implemented:**
- RDMA reads from root to leaf
- Uses level-specific local buffers
- Follows child pointers based on key ranges
- **Builds parent_map during descent** for split operations
- Returns parsed leaf node (not just address)

### 5. **Helper Functions**
- ‚úÖ `calculate_tree_height()` - Computes optimal height
- ‚úÖ `allocate_node_address()` - Level-based address allocation
- ‚úÖ `get_child_index_for_key()` - Binary search in internal nodes
- ‚úÖ `parse_node_from_buffer()` - Deserializes node from RDMA buffer
- ‚úÖ `find_parent_address()` - Locates parent of a node
- ‚úÖ `get_rdma_interface_for_address()` - Routes to correct memory server

## ‚ùå What is MISSING (Production Features)

### 1. **Delete Operation (Incomplete)**

#### Missing: Borrow from Sibling
```cpp
// NEEDED: When node underflows, borrow from sibling
void borrow_from_sibling(BTreeNode& underflow_node, uint64_t parent_addr)
```
**What it should do:**
- Find left or right sibling
- Check if sibling has extra keys (> min_keys)
- Move one key from sibling through parent
- Update parent separator key
- Write back all modified nodes

#### Missing: Merge with Sibling
```cpp
// NEEDED: When borrowing not possible, merge nodes
void merge_with_sibling(BTreeNode& underflow_node, uint64_t parent_addr)
```
**What it should do:**
- Find sibling to merge with
- Combine keys from both nodes
- Delete separator key from parent
- Free memory of deleted node
- Recursively handle parent underflow
- Decrease tree height if root becomes empty

### 2. **Range Queries**
```cpp
// MISSING: Range scan operations
std::vector<std::pair<uint64_t, uint64_t>> range_query(uint64_t start_key, uint64_t end_key)
```
**What's needed:**
- Traverse to starting leaf
- Follow leaf pointers (sibling links)
- Collect all keys in range
- Handle cross-server leaf chains

### 3. **Bulk Operations**
```cpp
// MISSING: Bulk insert optimization
void bulk_insert(std::vector<std::pair<uint64_t, uint64_t>>& kvs)
```
**What's needed:**
- Sort keys first
- Build bottom-up for efficiency
- Batch RDMA writes
- Optimize tree construction

### 4. **Concurrency Control**
Currently **NO concurrency control** implemented:
- ‚ùå No locks (neither optimistic nor pessimistic)
- ‚ùå No version numbers
- ‚ùå No MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)
- ‚ùå No transaction support
- ‚ùå Multiple compute servers would cause race conditions

**What's needed:**
```cpp
void acquire_lock(uint64_t node_address)
void release_lock(uint64_t node_address)
bool validate_version(uint64_t node_address, uint64_t version)
```

### 5. **Node Persistence**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses `cached_nodes` map to simulate memory persistence
- ‚ùå No actual memory backend (memory servers don't exist yet)
- ‚ùå `parse_node_from_buffer()` reads from cache, not actual RDMA buffer
- ‚ùå No durability (no WAL, no checkpointing)

**TODO in code:**
```cpp
// From parse_node_from_buffer():
// TODO: Actually read from buffer_address in a real implementation
```

### 6. **Advanced Features**

#### Missing: Sibling Pointers (Leaf Chain)
```cpp
struct BTreeNode {
    uint64_t next_leaf;     // MISSING: pointer to next leaf (for range queries)
    uint64_t prev_leaf;     // MISSING: pointer to previous leaf
}
```

#### Missing: Node Defragmentation
- No compaction of deleted space
- No node rebalancing without splits

#### Missing: Statistics & Monitoring
- No per-level statistics
- No memory utilization tracking
- No hotspot detection

#### Missing: Recovery
- No crash recovery
- No consistency checks
- No tree validation/repair

### 7. **Performance Optimizations**

#### Missing: Caching
```cpp
// MISSING: Real LRU cache for frequently accessed nodes
class NodeCache {
    void put(uint64_t address, BTreeNode node);
    BTreeNode* get(uint64_t address);
    void evict();
}
```

#### Missing: Prefetching
- No look-ahead during traversal
- No batch RDMA reads

#### Missing: Write Combining
- No batching of writes
- No deferred writes

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Limitations

### 1. **Memory Backend**
Currently uses **simulation**:
```cpp
std::map<uint64_t, BTreeNode> cached_nodes;  // Simulates remote memory
```

**What's needed:**
- Real memory server processes
- Actual RDMA hardware/simulation
- Proper request/response handling

### 2. **Synchronous Operations**
All operations are **blocking**:
- Insert waits for all RDMA writes to complete
- Search waits for RDMA reads
- No pipelining of operations

**What's needed:**
- Asynchronous RDMA operations
- Callbacks for completion
- Request batching

### 3. **Single-Threaded**
- One compute server operates alone
- No coordination between multiple compute servers
- No distributed consensus

---

## üìù Summary

| Feature | Status | Production Ready? |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| **Insert** | ‚úÖ Fully implemented | ‚ö†Ô∏è No concurrency |
| **Search** | ‚úÖ Fully implemented | ‚ö†Ô∏è No caching |
| **Delete** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial (no merge) | ‚ùå Incomplete |
| **Leaf Split** | ‚úÖ Full recursive | ‚ö†Ô∏è Works for inserts |
| **Internal Split** | ‚úÖ Full recursive | ‚ö†Ô∏è Works for inserts |
| **Range Query** | ‚ùå Not implemented | ‚ùå Missing |
| **Concurrency** | ‚ùå Not implemented | ‚ùå Unsafe |
| **Recovery** | ‚ùå Not implemented | ‚ùå No durability |
| **Memory Backend** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Simulated only | ‚ùå Not real |

**Bottom Line:** This is a **functional prototype** that demonstrates B+tree concepts over disaggregated memory. It handles inserts and searches correctly, including all split scenarios. However, it's **not production-ready** due to incomplete delete operations, lack of concurrency control, and simulated memory persistence.

For production use, you would need:
1. Complete delete with merge/borrow
2. Real memory server implementation
3. Concurrency control (locks or MVCC)
4. Durability guarantees (WAL, checkpointing)
5. Comprehensive testing and validation
