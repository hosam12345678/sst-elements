# Async Refactoring Summary

## ✅ **Completed Steps**

### **Step 1: Added AsyncOperation Structure**
- Added `AsyncOperation` struct to track multi-step async operations
- Includes operation type, key, value, current level, traversal path, and start time
- Located in: `computeServer.h`

### **Step 2: Removed cached_nodes Shortcut**
- **REMOVED**: `std::map<uint64_t, BTreeNode> cached_nodes`
- This was bypassing SST's memory simulation timing
- Now all data comes from actual memory responses

### **Step 3: Renamed RDMA → Network**
- `rdma_interface` → `memory_interface`
- `rdma_interfaces` → `memory_interfaces`
- `rdma_read()` → `network_read()`
- `rdma_write()` → `network_write()`
- `stat_rdma_reads` → `stat_network_reads`
- `stat_rdma_writes` → `stat_network_writes`
- `get_rdma_interface_for_address()` → `get_interface_for_address()`

### **Step 4: Added Async State Machine**
- **New member**: `std::map<Request::id_t, AsyncOperation> pending_ops`
- Tracks all in-flight async operations
- Each network request has associated state

### **Step 5: Rewrote handleMemoryEvent()**
- Now calls `handle_read_response()` and `handle_write_response()`
- Implements state machine continuation
- Processes real data from memory responses

### **Step 6: Added Async Entry Points**
- `btree_insert_async()` - starts async insert
- `btree_search_async()` - starts async search  
- `btree_delete_async()` - starts async delete
- Each initiates traversal from root

### **Step 7: Implemented Response Handlers**
- `handle_read_response()`:
  - Deserializes node from response data
  - Continues traversal if internal node
  - Calls `handle_leaf_operation()` if leaf reached
  - Updates statistics when operation completes

- `handle_write_response()`:
  - Handles write completion
  - Currently no special action needed

- `handle_leaf_operation()`:
  - Performs actual B+tree logic at leaf
  - INSERT: Inserts key/value or updates
  - SEARCH: Finds key and reports result
  - DELETE: Removes key from leaf

### **Step 8: Added Serialization Functions**
- `deserialize_node()` - converts bytes → BTreeNode
- `serialize_node()` - converts BTreeNode → bytes
- `write_node_back()` - serializes and sends write request

### **Step 9: Updated initialize_btree()**
- Now writes root node to memory using `write_node_back()`
- No longer caches root locally
- Root data comes from memory on first read

## 📊 **How It Works Now**

### **Timeline Example: Insert Key=42**

```
T=0ns:   btree_insert_async(42) called
         ├─ Create Read(root_address)
         ├─ pending_ops[req1] = {INSERT, key=42, level=0}
         └─ send(req1) → schedules at T+1ns

T=1ns:   MemoryServer receives Read
         └─ Sends ReadResp with root node data

T=2ns:   handleMemoryEvent(ReadResp) called
         ├─ handle_read_response(req1, data)
         ├─ node = deserialize_node(data)  ← REAL data!
         ├─ node.is_leaf? No
         ├─ child_addr = node.children[index]
         ├─ Create Read(child_addr)
         ├─ pending_ops[req2] = {INSERT, key=42, level=1}
         └─ send(req2) → schedules at T+3ns

T=3ns:   MemoryServer receives Read
         └─ Sends ReadResp with child node data

T=4ns:   handleMemoryEvent(ReadResp) called
         ├─ handle_read_response(req2, data)
         ├─ node = deserialize_node(data)  ← REAL data!
         ├─ node.is_leaf? Yes!
         ├─ handle_leaf_operation(op, node)
         │  ├─ Insert key=42 into node
         │  ├─ node.num_keys++
         │  └─ write_node_back(node)
         └─ stat_ops_completed++ (DONE!)

T=5ns:   MemoryServer receives Write
         └─ Stores modified node

T=6ns:   Write complete
         └─ Total latency: 6ns
```

## 🔑 **Key Differences from Before**

| Aspect | Before (Cached) | After (Async) |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Data source** | `cached_nodes` map | Real memory responses |
| **Timing** | Instant (fake) | 2ns per hop (realistic) |
| **Code style** | Synchronous | Asynchronous state machine |
| **traverse_to_leaf()** | Returns node immediately | Multi-step with callbacks |
| **Memory writes** | Cached locally | Actually written to memory servers |
| **Statistics** | Showed 2ns but used cache | True 2ns with real data |

## 📝 **What's Still TODO**

1. **Async Split Operations**
   - Currently splits not implemented in async version
   - Need to break split_leaf() into async steps
   - Need to break insert_into_parent() into async steps

2. **Remove Old Synchronous Code**
   - Keep old `btree_insert()`, `btree_search()`, `btree_delete()` for reference
   - Can be removed once async versions are fully tested

3. **Error Handling**
   - Add timeout handling for hung requests
   - Handle memory server failures
   - Retry logic for transient errors

4. **Optimization**
   - Batch multiple reads for same level
   - Pipeline traversal requests
   - Add local caching layer (optional, for performance)

## ✅ **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Compile successfully
- [ ] Run simple insert test
- [ ] Run simple search test
- [ ] Run simple delete test
- [ ] Verify memory reads/writes in statistics
- [ ] Check latency measurements
- [ ] Test with multiple operations
- [ ] Verify data persistence across operations

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Compile and test** the async version
2. **Debug any issues** with serialization/deserialization
3. **Implement async splits** (most complex part)
4. **Remove old sync code** once async version is stable
5. **Add performance optimizations** as needed
